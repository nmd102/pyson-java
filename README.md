# Pyson Java

Pyson parser written in java (original repository [here](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON))

Eventually I will publish this with maven, but for now you can copy the co.josh.pyson folder into your project, and then go from there.

## Documentation
What you thought there would be documentation?

As of right now, there is no documentation. However, you can look at the code from the [original pyson implementation](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON/blob/main/src/pyson_data/pyson.py) and read the comments there, as the API is about the same.
